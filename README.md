# Sentiment-Analysis

 We used AWS Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) platform to run a series of Hadoop Streaming jobs that collected 
 smart phone-related web pages from the Common Crawl January 2020.
 
 Used R and already coded datasets with historical data abount iPhone and Samsung Galaxy
 to build models in order to predict, using the common crawl obtained data,  the sentiment clients have on iPhone and Samsung.
